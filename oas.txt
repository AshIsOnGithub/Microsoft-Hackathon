    "description": "## Overview\nThis API provides content from the [NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk) as JSON, to be consumed programmatically and used by your application.\n\nYou can reuse the content from the following sections of the NHS website:\n  * Health A to Z / Conditions ([Website](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/) | [API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-website-content/v2#get-/conditions))\n  * Medicines A to Z ([Website](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/) | [API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-website-content/v2#get-/medicines))\n  * Mental health ([Website](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/) | [API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-website-content/v2#get-/mental-health))\n  * Live Well ([Website](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/) | [API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-website-content/v2#get-/live-well))\n  * Pregnancy ([Website](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/) | [API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-website-content/v2#get-/pregnancy))\n  * NHS services ([Website](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/) | [API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-website-content/v2#get-/nhs-services))\n  * Contraception ([Website](https://www.nhs.uk/contraception/) | [API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-website-content/v2#get-/contraception))\n  * Vaccinations ([Website](https://www.nhs.uk/vaccinations/) | [API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-website-content/v2#get-/vaccinations))\n  * Women's health ([Website](https://www.nhs.uk/womens-health/) | [API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-website-content/v2#get-/womens-health))\n\nYou cannot use this API to:\n  * [find services near you](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/services-near-you/)\n  * get Ratings and Reviews of NHS services.\n\nIf you are migrating from our [old NHS website APIs](https://developer.api.nhs.uk/nhs-api), we have a [migration guide](https://developer.api.nhs.uk/support/migration/guide) to help walk you through the process and a [migration assistant](https://developer.api.nhs.uk/support/migration/assistant) to illustrate the differences in how your API requests will need to be updated.\n\n## Who can use this API\nAnyone can use this API for any purpose, so long as they have agreed to the [Online connection agreement](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/online-connection-agreement) during the [onboarding process](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/onboarding-process) and they include an [attribution](#overview--attribution) as outlined below.\n\n## Attribution\nAny syndicated content must incorporate the following attribution (credit) to the NHS website:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://assets.nhs.uk/nhsuk-cms/images/nhs-attribution.width-510.png\" alt=\"Content supplied by the NHS website\" width=\"510\" height=\"99\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 49px;\" /\u003E\n\nThe logo should be clearly visible and in line with the associated content on every web page that contains the syndicated content. You should also link this logo to the relevant page on the NHS website that the content has been supplied from.\n\n```\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/PATH_TO_THE_ORIGINAL_CONTENT_ON_THE_NHS_WEBSITE\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E\n  \u003Cimg src=\"https://assets.nhs.uk/nhsuk-cms/images/nhs-attribution.width-510.png\" alt=\"Content supplied by the NHS website\" width=\"510\" height=\"99\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 49px;\" /\u003E\n\u003C/a\u003E\n```\n\nThe logo image URL is supplied as part of the JSON response under author:\n\n```\n\"author\": {\n  \"url\": \"https://www.nhs.uk\",\n  \"logo\": \"https://assets.nhs.uk/nhsuk-cms/images/nhs-attribution.width-510.png\",\n  \"email\": \"nhswebsite.servicedesk@nhs.net\",\n  \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n  \"name\": \"NHS website\"\n}\n```\n\nIf you are displaying NHS syndicated content in a context where a functional link back to the article on the NHS website is not possible then you should use the following attribution (credit):\n\n```\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom \u003Ca href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ewww.nhs.uk\u003Ca/\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n```\n\n## Modularised content\nThe standard content available through our syndication service is based on the full pages on the NHS website. With our modularised content, you can instead choose to use shorter, more specific sections of content (called \"modules\") from our pages. This means you can show your users only the content that's most relevant to them. You can also use this content more easily in services like apps and voice assistants.\n\n### Benefits of our modularised content\n\n1. **More relevant content for users** &mdash; Users do not always want or need full pages of content. With our modularised content, you can choose exactly what your users get.\n\n2. **Suitable for a range of services** &mdash; Short, specific content modules can be used more easily than full web pages in services like apps, chatbots and voice assistants.\n\n3. **Clinical assurance** &mdash; Each module is checked by NHS clinicians before being made available and carries the trusted NHS brand.\n\n### Available labels / health aspects\n\nWe create modules by adding labels (health aspects) to sections of content on our web pages. For example, on our medical condition pages we have labels (health aspects) for sections on \"Overview\", \"Symptoms\", \"Treatments\", \"Causes\" and more. These labels (health aspects) are based on international standards for structured data from [Schema.org](https://schema.org/HealthAspectEnumeration). Before being made available, each module is checked by our clinical team to make sure it remains accurate and safe to use in isolation.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"nhsd-m-expander\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\"\u003E\n  \u003Cdetails\u003E\n    \u003Csummary class=\"nhsd-m-expander__heading-container\" aria-label=\"List of health aspects\" \u003E\n      \u003Cdiv\u003E\n        \u003Cspan class=\"nhsd-m-expander__icon nhsd-!t-margin-right-1\"\u003E\n          \u003Cspan class=\"nhsd-a-icon nhsd-a-icon--size-xs\" style=\"margin: 0;\"\u003E\n            \u003Csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid meet\" focusable=\"false\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"\u003E\n              \u003Cpath d=\"M12,8l-6.5,7L4,13.5L9.2,8L4,2.5L5.5,1L12,8z\"/\u003E\n            \u003C/svg\u003E\n          \u003C/span\u003E\n        \u003C/span\u003E\n        \u003Cp class=\"nhsd-m-expander__heading nhsd-t-body\"\u003EList of health aspects\u003C/p\u003E\n      \u003C/div\u003E\n    \u003C/summary\u003E\n    \u003Cdiv class=\"nhsd-m-expander__content-container\"\u003E\n      \u003Cp\u003EHere are the 31 health aspects that we currently have available for modularisation, in order of frequency of use:\u003C/p\u003E\n      \u003Cul\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003EOverviewHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003ESymptomsHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003ETreatmentsHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003ECausesHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003EMedicalHelpNonurgentHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003ESelfCareHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003EMedicalHelpUrgentHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003EMedicalHelpEmergencyHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003EDiagnosisHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003EPreventionHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003ESideEffectsHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003ELivingWithHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003ESuitabilityHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003EInteractionsHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003EUsageOrScheduleHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003EPregnancyHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003ERisksOrComplicationsHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003EPrognosisHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003EBenefitsHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003EContagiousnessHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003EWhatHappensHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003EPreparationHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003EResultsHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003ETypesHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003EContraindicationsHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003EGettingAccessHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003EWarningHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003EEffectivenessHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003EHowItWorksHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n        \u003Cli\u003EIngredientsHealthAspect\u003C/li\u003E\n      \u003C/ul\u003E\n    \u003C/div\u003E\n  \u003C/details\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\n### Getting modularised content\n\nTo get modularised content, you can use the boolean `modules` query parameter in the [conditions/*](#get-/conditions/*) and [medicines/*](#get-/medicines/*) endpoints. This will return the modularised version of the page (if there is one). If the requested page has not been modularised, the full page will be returned.\n\nYou can get a list of which pages have (and have not) been modularised and which health aspects they contain by calling the `/manifest/pages/` endpoint.\n\n## Schema page types\n\nThroughout the NHS website we have a couple of page models which are defined using the `@type` property. It is a good thing to implement each page type into your product, as multiple page types can be used within in a single genre (conditions, live-well, medicines, etc).\n\n1. **WebPage** &mdash; This is the default type and is [defined by Schema.org](https://schema.org/WebPage)\n\n2. **MedicalWebPage** &mdash; A web page that provides medical information and is [defined by Schema.org](https://schema.org/MedicalWebPage)\n\nHere is a list of properties for each schema page type we are currently using:\n\n| WebPage          | MedicalWebPage      |\n| ---------------- | ------------------- |\n| @context         | @context            |\n| @type            | @type               |\n| name             | name                |\n| copyrightHolder  | copyrightHolder     |\n| license          | license             |\n| author           | author              |\n| about            | about               |\n| description      | description         |\n| url              | url                 |\n| genre            | genre               |\n| keywords         | keywords            |\n| dateModified     | dateModified        |\n| lastReviewed     | lastReviewed        |\n| breadcrumb       | breadcrumb          |\n| hasPart          | hasPart             |\n| relatedLink      | relatedLink         |\n| contentSubTypes  | contentSubTypes     |\n| mainEntityOfPage | mainEntityOfPage    |\n|                  | alternativeHeadline |\n\nIt is worth noting that the `genre` property is what we use to define which section the article sits in, and the `@type` is used to define how that article is structured.\n\n## API status\nThis API has moved from the [NHS website developer portal](https://developer.api.nhs.uk/). \nIt is currently [in production](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses).\n\n## Service level\nThis API is a [bronze service](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).\n\n## Technology\nThis API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).\n\nPage objects conform to global [schema.org](https://schema.org/) standards.\n\n## Network access\nThis API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).\n\nTo use this API with [NHS smartcards](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers), the end user needs an HSCN connection, although internet-facing alternatives to smartcards are available.\n\nFor more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).\n\n## Security and authorisation\n\nThis API use the [Application-restricted RESTful API - API key authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-api-key-authentication) security pattern, meaning we authenticate the calling application but not the end user.\n\nWhen calling the Integration Test environment or Production environment, you must provide a valid `apikey` in your request header.\n\nTo obtain an API key for each of these environments you must sign in to the [NHS Digital Onboarding Service - Developer account](https://onboarding.prod.api.platform.nhs.uk/Index) and register your application to be granted [environment access](https://onboarding.prod.api.platform.nhs.uk/MyApplications).\n\nYour API keys will look something like: `XW7DGBVQzO0yPKdPbRXeqITzbdJ1jNh7` (example apikey)\n\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENOTE:\u003C/strong\u003E You will not need the 'Secret', and you don't need to specify a 'Public key URL' or a 'Callback URL' to use this API.\n\n## Errors\nWe use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:\n  * 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action\n  * 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application\n  * 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server.\n\nErrors specific to each endpoint are shown in the endpoints section, under response. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes) for more on errors.\n\n## Environments and testing\n| Environment       | Base URL                                                               |\n| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Sandbox           |

[sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):\n* is for early developer testing\n* only covers a limited set of scenarios\n* is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation (you do not need to provide an `apikey` in the request header)\n* is [rate limited](#overview--usage-caps)\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"nhsd-m-expander\"

By default if any of the `orderBy` parameters are chosen the results are sorted by newest first.\n\nHowever, the `orderBy` parameter can be used with the `startDate` and `endDate` parameters to filter down to the desired date. `startDate` and `endDate` should be given in the YYYY-MM-DD format.\n\nFor example `https://api.service.nhs.uk/nhs-website-content/medicines?startDate=2022-01-01&orderBy=dateModified`\n",
